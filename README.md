# Piggy2

This is, as yet, a simple program for members of the QinetiQ Defined Contribution / old benefit pension scheme.
It downloads all the fund file pdfs, and reads them, extracting performance up to 5 years. The only reason for the program to exist is Mercer not supplying the equivalent data, and I hated writing it all out by hand.

The name is dreadful and will be changed, it is a reference to the pigpdf reader library I have used.

There may be errors so always double-check on the money4life we site to confirm you've got the data correctly.
